AI-Based Early Disease Detection System

🚀 Early detection of chronic diseases using AI & predictive analytics
Overview
This project is an AI-driven healthcare platform designed to detect chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and kidney disorders using machine learning models and predictive analytics.

Key Features
✅ Chronic Disease Risk Prediction – AI-powered assessment based on patient data.
✅ Symptom Checker (NLP-powered) – Predicts possible conditions based on symptoms.
✅ Health Dashboard – Displays health metrics like blood pressure, glucose, and BMI.
✅ Chatbot Integration – AI-powered chatbot for health-related queries.
✅ Medical Report Analysis – Upload reports for AI-driven insights and early detection.
✅ Cloud Deployment (AWS) – Secure storage & remote access.
